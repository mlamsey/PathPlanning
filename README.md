# UTK Arc Laboratory: Path Planning Project
Path Planning Software written in MATLAB

## Purpose + Summary
This project aims to create an integrated software system that will convert previously generated contours (continuous sets of points in 3-space) into robot trajectories. Currently, the contours are generated using the metrology software GOM Inspect, and the target environment for the robot trajectories is Octopuz (via .path files).
